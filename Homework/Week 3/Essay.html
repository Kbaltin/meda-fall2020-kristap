    <h1>Kristap Baltin – Personal Tutoring Session, 5-10 minute Lesson Plan on Being a Good Student</h1>
</div>



<div class="box">
    <p><h2>1) Getting To Know You</h2></p>
</div> 

<div id="two">    
    <p id="two">Write down two things you do really well and give a couple of short examples of why you think you are good at 
    this and when you have done it recently. It doesn’t have to be overly complicated and your responses can be as simple as “I’m 
    really good at walking, Just last week, I took three different hikes 
    and I feel great getting the exercise and being out in nature.” </p>
</div>

    <p id="two">(The purpose of this first section of the lesson is for teacher and student to get to know each a little bit 
        better in order to build better rapport and to listen to each other more effectively. Once the student becomes 
        used to listening to the teacher in a more casual way, it will be easier for them to retain the more complicated 
        bits of the lesson after)</p>

<div class="box"><p><h2> 2) The Setting of Expectations for Future Tutoring Sessions and Lessons.</h2></p></div>


<div id="three">
<ul>
    <p><li id="three">Be prepared for future sessions by making sure to bring all relevant material to the classroom. 
        For example, we can’t as effectively work on improving your writing if you don’t have the writing sample with 
        you that you would like to improve or that that you got a bad grade on. If you are working on a specific text 
        to improve your reading, make sure you bring that text with you to our sessions.</li></p>
    
    <p><li>Keep a difficulty journal – If you come across something that you don’t understand or a concept you are 
        struggling with, write it down in your difficulty journal so as to remember it and work through it on your own 
        time and during our session. I can be a great resource for you in how to work out difficult problems and get 
        information on how to learn through our difficulty.</li></p>

    <p><li>Always ask questions during our sessions, and feel free to bring questions with you into our sessions. Part 
        of intellectual engagement is the ability to formulate inquisitive and relevant questions.</li></p>

    <p><li>Come to our sessions on time and be well-rested and energized. It is much easier to learn, when you have energy 
        and feel motivated.</li></p>
</ul>
</div>

    <p id="two">(The purpose of this second part is to pre-teach the concepts of being a good student. The next sessions 
        and classes will be more productive, if the student is aware of the teacher’s expectations and understands what 
        they need to do in order to have successful sessions.)</p>

<div class="box"><h2>3)The Beginning of the Lesson</h2></div>

<ul>
    <p><li>Write down the qualities you have to have or practice to be a good student. They can be adjectives or they 
        can be actions. Please write a list of at least 5 qualities. After you are finished we will talk about these 
        qualities and why we think they describe a good student.</li></p>

    <p><li>I will provide a list of my own and we will discuss it as well.</li></p>

    <p><li>My list –</li></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart</li>
        <li>Knows a lot</li>
        <li>Creative</li>
        <li>Curious</li>
        <li>Self-motivated</li>
        <li>Involved</li>
   
    </ul>
</ul> 
        

<p id="two">(The purpose of this section is to activate the student’s schemata or already inherent knowledge of what being 
    a good student is. Once the student has done the work for themselves of defining this concept, they can further build on it, 
    through our discussion of what qualities they need in order to succeed and thrive in this class. I have purposely put some 
    qualities on my list that are not necessary to be a good student, but that students sometimes erroneously associate with 
    good students. For example, being smart is highly subjective and there are ample examples of students being smart and 
    unmotivated thereby marking them as not good students. Knowing a lot is also not a pre-requisite of being a good student 
    and can rather make someone closed off and disinterested. I want to make sure that the student understands that difficulty 
    is inherent in the process of learning and is a positive rather than a negative concept.)</p>

<div class="box"><h2>4)Review and conclusion</h2></div>

<ul>
    <li>Have the student summarize what we have learned about each other.</li>
    <li>Have the student recount the expectations for our next session.</li>
    <li>Have the student summarize the qualities of being a good student.</li>
    <li>Preview next week’s lesson on what Learning is and how to do it well.</li></ul>

<p id="two">This lesson is a part of five beginning lessons teaching students the essentials of being a student, understanding 
    what learning is, how to gain motivation and inquisitiveness, how to formulate questions, read critically and find resources 
    to further and aid their learning process.</p>
