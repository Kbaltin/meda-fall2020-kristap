            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kristap Baltin, and I'm an aspiring web page designer looking to provide businesses with pages that are
                functional, easy to use, and provide simple, pleasing layouts that intuitively guide the user through the site 
                without distractions and capitalize on content to create conversions.<br><br>
                
                In a world of ambiguity and abstraction, it is nice to have a guide that knows what you need and where you want to go.
                I use this website to take the visitor through a journey of three iconic cities and to display my philosophy of
                simplicity, and a clear, lucid, simple and concise design.<br><br> 
                
                Current day website visitors attempt to have their needs met everyday through seeking services that are transparent
                and take them to where they need to go. In many cases, their attempts are met with frustration as they visit sites
                that bombard them with advertisements, clunky and confusing designs, and superfluous information and content that
                inevitably chases them away into arms of competitors who understand utility and efficiency.<br><br>
                
                I hope my website can display my philosophy of simplicity and easy navigation through a representation of three different
                areas capturing the spirit and soul of the cities the images portray.</p>
